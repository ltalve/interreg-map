This is a hobby project where I concentrate in practising:

a) importing, fixing and combining data from .xlsx and .csv with Python
b) testing with Pytest
c) design patterns

The end result of my code will be a csv file that I can use in QGIS for creating an online map presentation 
of a data set presenting Interreg project financing from the EU during the 2014-2020 financing period.
The online map is published on GitHub pages: https://ltalve.github.io/interreg-map/.

Interreg data used in the project is collected from the keep.eu database available at http://keep.eu.
NUTS data is from Eurostat: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts
